##### Overriding
The overriding method cannot have a more restrictive access modifier. </br>
This is because the subclass should be accessible via the superclass reference (polimorphism)
</br>
</br>
The overriding method cannot throw a broader Exception.
</br>
</br>
The overriding method should return the same type or a subtype.
</br>
</br>
You cannot override static methods. This is called hiding.
</br>
An instance method cannot override a static method, and a static method cannot hide an instance method.
